  <h4>Jabberwocky</h4>
  <p>
    Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
    All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
    And the mome raths outgrabe.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
    The frumious Bandersnatch!

    He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>
    Long time the manxome foe he sought<br>
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
    And stood awhile in thought.
  </p>

  <p>
    And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
    The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
    And burbled as it came!
  </p>

  <p>
    One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
    The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
    He left it dead, and with its head<br>
    He went galumphing back.
  </p>

  <p>
    And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
    Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
    O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!<br>
    He chortled in his joy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
    All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
    And the mome raths outgrabe.
